    Extract CoT reasoning and final answer from model output.

    Primary format (Supplementary Material):
    <|think|>
    {reasoning}
    <|answer|>
    {answer}

    Fallback formats, tried in order:
    - only one of the two markers present (generation cut short by a stop
      sequence or a token limit)
    - "[ANSWER_START]<answer>[ANSWER_END]", closing marker optional
